# **_Story inspired by my favorite game of all time, Old School RuneScape_**

## Outline
### Theme
Ancient crypt exploration with a fantasy horror atmosphere.

### Lore
Legends whisper of the Barrows Brothers, six mighty warriors who assisted in the conquering of Forinthry by Saradomin, the Lord of Light. Laid to rest within a labyrinthine crypt, their tombs are laden with powerful artifacts. Driven by ambition and the promise of untold riches, you embark on a perilous expedition into this forsaken place, unaware of the malevolent presence that awaits within. 

### Objective
The old man at the inn, with his eyes glossed over from one too many pints of Dwarven Stout, gave you a grave warning before you left for the Barrows. "Ahrim the Blighted guards his brothers' tombs with a vengeance," he rasped. "To survive his wrath, claim a piece of gear from each of the fallen, as well as their gods-forsaken amulet. Seven artifacts in total, each a ward against his unholy magic." He leaned closer, his voice barely a whisper. "Fail to heed my words, and you become another forgotten soul, lost to the darkness of the Barrows."

### Rooms and Items
These are simply the notable rooms. Various transitional corridors will connect them, creating a labyrinthine feel.
